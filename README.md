# Welcome to the Pet Adoption Website!

Here you have the chance to take home a cute, cuddily cat/dog or a scaly, deadly dino. There's a small description for each pet available, which included the pet's color and brief summary of it's special skills. There are 4 sort buttons at the top of the page. Clicking on the cats button will make only 'cat' display on the page and the same functionality will be present for the 'dog' and dino buttons. There will also be an 'all' button that will display all of the pet types on the screen.

Enjoy!
